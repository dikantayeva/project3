# AI-DRIVEN PREDICTION OF CONTAINER OVERFLOW FOR SMART WASTE COLLECTION IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS

# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a waste container will reach a critical fill level (75%) within a given time window using machine learning techniques. The aim is to assist in optimizing waste collection schedules and reduce unnecessary fuel usage and operational costs for waste management services.

# Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - seaborn

# Running the Project:
This project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook (`project3.ipynb`).  
To run it:
1. Open the notebook with Jupyter:
   bash
   jupyter notebook project3.ipynb
   
2. The code reads data from a CSV file:
   final_dataset_correct_truck_arrival.csv
